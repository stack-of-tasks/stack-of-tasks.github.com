## First steps with dynamic graph

We assume that the stack of tasks has been installed using the installation instruction provided [here](download).

### dynamic-graph 101

This first tutorial focuses on the dynamic-graph mecanism, which is the backbone of the stack of tasks framework.

As a toy example, let's realize this operation `res=(a+b)*(c+d)` using dynamic-graph elements.
The corresponding code would be this:

```python
from dynamic_graph import plug
from dynamic_graph.sot.core.operator import Add_of_double
from dynamic_graph.sot.core.operator import Multiply_of_double
a=1
b=2
c=3
d=4

# Crate  the entities
ad1  = Add_of_double('ad1')
ad2  = Add_of_double('ad2')
mult = Multiply_of_double('mult')

# Fix the values of the input for the first operation
ad1.sin1.value = a
ad1.sin2.value = b

# Fix the values of the input for the second operation
ad2.sin1.value = c
ad2.sin2.value = d

# plug all the signals
plug(ad1.sout, mult.sin0)
plug(ad2.sout, mult.sin1)
```

In order to obtain the result of the multiplication, let's do:
```python
mult.sout.value
#> 0
```

This is normal.
At the creation of an entity, each of the signals has a default value associated to the time 0.
In order to have the new value, it is necessary to increment the time, so as to trigger the recomputation.
```python
mult.sout.time
#> 0
mult.sout.recompute(1)
mult.sout.value
#> 21
```

Let's now change one of the inputs of the entity ad1.
```python
ad1.sin1.value = 0
```

The result becomes:
```python
mult.sout.recompute(2)
mult.sout.value
#> 14
```

Note that the intermediary signal ad1.sout, has been updated, while ad2.sout hasn't:
```python
ad1.sout.time
#> 2
ad2.sout.time
#> 1
```

### Dynamic-graph operations

Here is a list of some basic operations that can be run on the entities/signals.
A more complete list can be found in the cheat sheet (Documentation > Cheat sheet).

#### Entity manipulation

- `entity.help()`: Displays the help for an entity, namely the commands with their description

    ```python
    ad1.help()
    Linear combination of inputs
      - input  double
      -        double
      - output double
      sout = coeff1 * sin0 + coeff2 * sin1
      Coefficients are set by commands, default value is 1.

    List of commands:
    -----------------
    setCoeff1:      Set the coeff1.
    setCoeff2:      Set the coeff2.
    ```

- `entity.help('command')`: Displays the complete help for the command (number of argument...)

    ```python
    ad1.help('setCoeff1')
    setCoeff1:

    Set the coeff1.

    Input:
     - a double.
    Void return.
    ```

- `entity.commands()` Returns the list of commands of an entity, without description

    ```python
    ad1.commands()
    ('setCoeff1', 'setCoeff2')
    ```

- `entity.displaySignals()`: Lists the signals of an entity, indicates whether they are plugged or not.
    - AUTOPLUGGED: the signal is plugged to a signal of this entity, eventually internal</li>
    - PLUGGED: the signal is plugged to another one, from an other entity</li>
    - UNPLUGGED: the signal is not plugged. Requiring its recomputation will cause some issues</li>

    ```python
    ad1.displaySignals()
    --- <ad1> signal list:
        |-- <Sig:Add_of_double(ad1)::input(double)::sin0> (Type Cst) AUTOPLUGGED
        |-- <Sig:Add_of_double(ad1)::input(double)::sin1> (Type Cst) AUTOPLUGGED
        `-- <Sig:Add_of_double(ad1)::output(double)::sout> (Type Fun)
    ```

#### Signal manipulation

- `entity.signal.value`: Returns the current value of a signal

    ```python
    ad1.sin0.value
    0.0
    ```

- `entity.signal.time`: Returns the current time of a signal

    ```python
    ad1.sin1.time
    2
    ```

- `entity.signal.recompute(T)`: Force the recomputation of the signal for time T (only effective it the given time is greater than the current time).
