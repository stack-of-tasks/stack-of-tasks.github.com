<h2>Bridge with ROS</h2>

<h3>ROS messages to signals</h3>
Some entity and mecanisms allow you to exchange data from the ROS environment to the stack of tasks one, 
and convert ros messages in sot signals.
More details are provided <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_graph_bridge">on the ros wiki</a>

<h3>Executing python commands</h3>

The run_command service only considers the first line of your command, and does not accept end of line characters.
In other words, if you run this:
rosservice call run_command "print 'a'\n print 'b'"
You'll have this result:
result: <NULL>
  stdout: ''
  stderr: SyntaxError: ('unexpected character after line continuation character', ('<string>', 1, 21, "print 'a'\\n print 'b'"))

    But if you use this:
    rosservice call run_command "print 'a'; print 'b'"
    You'll have the expected result:
    result: None
    stdout: a
    b

    So you have 3 solutions:
    1. Use the python interpreter. If the use of the rosservice is not mandatory, this is the simplest solution.
    Calling run_command without args will start a python interface in which you can type python commands easily
    rosrun dynamic_graph_bridge run_command
    > ...

    2. make your instructions hold in one line (if applicable).
    rosservice call run_command  "'[(x+1) for x in [1,2,3]]'"

    3. write your instruction in a file and execute it.
    rosrun dynamic_graph_bridge run_command 'file.py'


    Note: in the future, please ask such questions in github. Especially in cases like this one where this can be attached to a specific repository.
    This will help future users that encounter the same issue.
