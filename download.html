<h2> Download </h2>

For the impatient we have binaries available on an apt repository
and a <a href="https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/sot-doc/doxygen/HEAD/c_installation_detailed.html">quickstart</a>.

You can download the sources and compile using the
<a href="https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/sot-doc/doxygen/HEAD/memo_catkin_tools.html">catkin tools<a/>.


  It is also possible to install each package independently !
