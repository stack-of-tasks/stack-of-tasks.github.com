<h2> How to install the stack of tasks on your machine?</h2>

<h2> Prerequisites</h2>
The current software architecture has been tested entirely on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

A large part of the basic algorithms have been tested on Windows and Mac a while go, but there is no guarantee that it is still true.

We advise the use of robotpkg to install the Stack of Tasks. You can try the install from the source code but we rather
advice its <a href="http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html">binary repository</a>.
You have to use also the <a href="http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html">wip (work in progress) part of robotpkg</a>.
Please follow the section entitled "Binary packages in robotpkg/wip".

<h3> Dependencies</h3>

The needed software are:
- git, CMake, boost, lapack, blas, python 2.7
- CMake
- gcc, g++
- Doxygen (and eventually LaTeX for mathematical formula rendering)
- Boost
- Eigen
- ROS

Please note that most of the packages are ROS-independent, but some packages allow to link the SOT framework to ROS
(e.g. `dynamic_graph_bridge`, `redundant_manipulator_control`)

<h2> Binary installation</h2>

We are currently providing the stack of tasks through robotpkg on Ubuntu 18.04, 16.04 and 14.04

<h3> Setting a source.list file</h3>
Robotpkg has two apt repository: a main repository and a work-in-progress repository:
```bash
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/robotpkg.list <<EOF
deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/wip/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -cs) robotpkg
deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -cs) robotpkg
EOF
```

<h3> Register the robotpkg authentication key</h3>
```bash
curl http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/robotpkg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

<h3> Update the list of available packages</h3>
Please follow the instructions given [here](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html) to access the package repository.
>>>>>>> master:download.html

To install the package sot-core-v3 you can use
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install robotpkg-sot-core-v3
```

<h2> Source installation</h2>

The source installation can be realized through robotpkg.
Please follow the instructions given [here](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/install.html) to get the package repositories.

You will also have to install the wip (work in progress) part of robotpkg. The installation procedure is described [here](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html).

To compile and install the package `sot-core-v3` then you can type:

```bash
cd robotpkg/wip/sot-core-v3
make install
```


<h2> Environment variables</h2>

To setup the environment variables you can use the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export ROBOTPKG_BASE=/opt/openrobots
export PATH=$PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/sbin:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/plugin:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib64
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/lib/pkgconfig/
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/share:$ROBOTPKG_BASE/stacks
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:$ROBOTPKG_BASE
```

If you name the script **setup-opt-robotpkg.sh** then the variables are setup by
sourcing the file:
```bash
source setup-opt-robotpkg.sh
```
