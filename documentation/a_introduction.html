<h2>Writing a controller</h2>
The goal of the Stack-of-Tasks (SoT) is to provide a SDK in order to:
<ul>
  <li id="write_control_pb"> Write control problem for complex robots such as humanoid robots</li>
  <li id="test_control_pb"> Test them quickly using geometric settings (rviz, gepetto-viewer), dynamic simulators (ODE,Bullet), system simulator (Gazebo)</li>
  <li id="deploy_control_pb"> Deploy them in real robots (TALOS, HRP-2)</li>
</ul>
Depending on your target you might not be interested in using the full set of software we are providing.
But the main goal of this SDK is to consider a robot model $robot\_model$, its current state $\mathbf{x}$
and computes a control vector $\mathbf{u}$
to make the robot performs actions.
<br>
All our controllers are defined as optimization problems. We used either solvers of the shelves or we designed our own solvers depending of the targeted applications.
The free variables are the control vector $\mathbf{u}$ to apply to the system.
They are constraints which can be of several kinds: the mechanical constraints of the system with the environment, the behavior that we want the robot to follow.
The next two following sections introduce our software framework to take into account those two constraints.


<h2> Necessary Constraints </h2>

<h3 id="Dynamics_system"> Dynamic modeling of a free-floating multi-body system</h3>
The dynamic model of a free-floating multi-body system can be written this way:
$$\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\ddot{q}} + \mathbf{N}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{\dot{q}})\mathbf{\dot{q}}+ \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{u}$$
with $\mathbf{q}$ the robot state variable, $\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{q})$ the inertia matrix of the multi-body system, $N(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{\dot{q}})$ the matrix
of the non-linear dynamical effect (Centrifugal and Coriolis forces) of the system motion, $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q})$ the gravity, $\mathbf{u}$ a control vector,
and $\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{q})$ the matrix mapping the control vector on the system.
<br>
The current software library we are using to computate such quantities and theirs derivatives
 is <a href="http://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/">Pinocchio</a><sup>
  <a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. Pinocchio include dynamical quantities such as angular momentum and its derivatives.

<h3 id="Contact models">Contact models</h3>

When considering a rigid contact model several constraints needs to be considered:
<ul>
  <li>No penetration in the ground</li>
  <li>No sliding</li>
</ul>
Both constraints generate inequalities at the contact points with respect to the state vector:
$$\mathbf{\phi}_n(\mathbf{q}) = 0$$
$$\mathbf{\phi}_t(\mathbf{q}) = 0$$
To avoid penetration velocity and acceleration of the points must be constrained too.  Using differentiation we obtain:
$$ \mathbf{C}_n(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{\dot{q}} = 0 $$
$$ \mathbf{C}_n(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{\ddot{q}} + \mathbf{s}_n(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{\dot{q}})= 0 $$
The same derivation can be realized to avoid sliding:
$$ \mathbf{C}_t(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{\dot{q}} = 0 $$
$$ \mathbf{C}_t(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{\ddot{q}} + \mathbf{s}_n(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{\dot{q}})= 0 $$

<h3 id="(Self-)collision"></h3>

Self-collisiion is usually avoiding by formulating an inequality constraint on the distance between two robot bodies.
To do that the closest two points between two shapes are tracked. The distance between two bodies is obtained through
a flavor of the FCL library.

<h2> Functions used to generate a robot behavior </h2>
<h3> Formulating tasks </h3>

<h4> Definition</h4>
Task ($\mathbf{e}$) are using features ($\mathbf{s}$). Features might be end-effector posision (hands, feet), the robot center-of-mass, or
the center-of-gravity of an object projected in the image.
We assume that a function relates the current state of the robot typically the configuration, speed, acceleration
to a feature. For instance, we may want to consider the Center-Of-Mass of a robot specified by a model $robot\_model$
and a configuration vector $\mathbf{q}$:

$$ \mathbf{f}_{CoM}: (robot\_model, \mathbf{q}) \rightarrow \mathbf{c}$$

We further assume that this function is at least differentiable once.

A task is then defined by the regulation between the feature depending on the current state $\mathbf{s}(\mathbf{q})$
of the robot and a desired feature $\mathbf{s}^*$:
$$ \mathbf{e} = \mathbf{s}(\mathbf{q})- \mathbf{s}^* $$

<h4> Imposing the task dynamic </h4>
You can impose for instance that the task dynamic is an exponential decay:
$$ \mathbf{\dot{e}} = - \lambda \mathbf{e}$$
But we also have:
$$\mathbf{\dot{e}} = \mathbf{\dot{s}}(\mathbf{q}) - \mathbf{\dot{s}}^*$$
If the desired feature does not move we have $\mathbf{\dot{s}}^*=0$, in addition we can remark that
$\mathbf{\dot{s}}(\mathbf{q})=\frac{\delta s}{\delta q}\mathbf{\dot{q}} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\dot{q}}$
Thus
$$\mathbf{\dot{e}} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\dot{q}} - \mathbf{\dot{s}}^*$$
At a given time $t=k\Delta T$ a measurement of the feature $\hat{\mathbf{s}}(t)$ can give us:
$$ \hat{\mathbf{e}}(t) = \hat{\mathbf{s}}(t) - \mathbf{s}^*(t)$$
By posing $\hat{\mathbf{e}}(t)=\mathbf{e}(t)$ we have:
$$ \mathbf{\dot{e}}(t) = - \lambda \mathbf{e}(t) = - \lambda \hat{\mathbf{e}}(t) = - \lambda (\hat{\mathbf{s}}(t) - \mathbf{s}^*(t))$$
We will continue by dropping $(t)$ for sake of clarity:
$$ - \lambda (\hat{\mathbf{s}} - \mathbf{s}^*) = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\dot{q}} \label{eq:equa_cst}$$
Therefore if $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})$ is invertible we can find $\mathbf{\dot{q}}$ using the following relationship:
$$ \mathbf{\dot{q}} = - \lambda \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})^{-1}(\hat{\mathbf{s}} - \mathbf{s}^*) $$
In general $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})$ is not square and then we have to use the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse:
$$ \mathbf{\dot{q}} = - \lambda \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})^{+}(\hat{\mathbf{s}} - \mathbf{s}^*) $$
But it can be also understood as the solution of the following optimization problem:
$$
\begin{array}
& argmin_{\mathbf{\dot{q}}} \parallel \mathbf{\dot{q}} \parallel \\
s.t. & - \lambda (\hat{\mathbf{s}} - \mathbf{s}^*) = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\dot{q}} \\
\end{array}

<sup id="fn1">1. [Historically we have used <a href="https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/jrl-dynamics">jrl-dynamics</a> coupled with the toolbox
<a href="http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/software/humans/">HuMAnS</a> for efficient computation. Unfortunately HuMAnS is using Mapple
so we tried to use a template based approach called
<a href="https://github.com/laas/metapod">Metapod</a> co-developed with Aldebaran Robotics now Softbank Robotics. Reading the book Rigid Body Dynamics from Featherstone
shows that generated code might lead to a lot of code loaded in the memory. This happens to be less efficient than compact code with simple loops
as implemented in Pinocchio.
